# Introduction to SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

*The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a step-by-step process used to plan, build, test and deliver software. It helps teams create high-quality software in a structured and organized way.*

*SDLC describes how software is developed from start to finish usually through stages like:*

1. *Understand what to build (requirements)*
2. *Plan and design the solution*
3. *Build it (development)*
4. *Testing*
5. *Deliver it (deployment)*
6. *Improve and fix it (maintenance)*

*Different SDLC models (like Waterfall and Agile) follow these stages in different ways.*

# Waterfall Model

*The waterfall model is a step by step software development process. You finish one phase completely before starting the next.*

### How it works:

1. *Requirements → understand everything first*
2. *Design → plan the whole system*
3. *Development → write all the code*
4. *Testing → test after all coding is done*
5. *Deployment → deliver the final product*
6. *Maintenance → fix issues and update*

### Key points:

1. *Like water flowing downwards, you cannot go back easily.*
2. *Best when requirements are fixed and do not change.*
3. *Very structured but slow to adapt to new changes.*

# Agile Model 

*Agile is a flexible and fast software development approach. Work is done in small parts, called sprints (1–4 weeks).*

### How it works:

1. *Build small features quickly*
2. *Test and get feedback immediately*
3. *Improve and repeat (every sprint)*

### Key points:

1. *Very flexible — changes can be made anytime.*
2. *Involves the customer throughout the project.*
3. *Faster delivery of useful features.*
4. *Team works collaboratively and improves continuously.*
