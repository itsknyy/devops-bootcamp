# DevOps Research and Assesment

## What is DORA?

It is a framework that helps companies measure how good their software development and delivery process is.   

## DORA has 4 main metrics

### 1. Deplyment Frequency
    How often do you release updates?
    - High = good

### 2. Lead Time for Chnages
    How long does it take from writing code → deploying to production?
    - Shorter time = better

### 3. Change Failure Rate
    When you deploy, how many deployments fail?
    - Lower failure rate = better

### 4. Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
    If something fails, how fast can you fix it?
    - Faster recovery = better

## Why is DORA important?

Because it shows:
- How fast your team moves
- How reliable the software is
- How good is the DevOps process

**High-performing companies always have good DORA metrics.**
